PROPERLY Fixed where if you tried to get alias/snippet docs while you had the alias/snippet open, it would replace the code with the docs. Now properly opens in a new tab.

Added new command: Avrae Utilities: Get Collection (All Content)

This command allows you to quickly get *all* of the content from a collection. Every alias, snippet, docs for both, and the collection docs as well.
